# There are n bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs, then you turn 
# off every second bulb.
# On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it's off or turning off if 
# it's on). For the ith round, you toggle every i bulb. For the nth round, you only 
# toggle the last bulb.
# Return the number of bulbs that are on after n rounds.
# Example 1:
# Input: n = 3
# Output: 1
# Explanation: At first, the three bulbs are [off, off, off].
# After the first round, the three bulbs are [on, on, on].
# After the second round, the three bulbs are [on, off, on].
# After the third round, the three bulbs are [on, off, off]. 
# So you should return 1 because there is only one bulb is on.
# Example 2:
# Input: n = 0
# Output: 0
# Example 3:
# Input: n = 1
# Output: 1
# Constraints: 
# â€¢ 0 <= n <= 109
# Example: 
# Input: n = 3
# Output: 1
# Explanation: 
 

# At first, the three bulbs are [off, off, off].

# After the second round, the three bulbs are [on, off, on].
